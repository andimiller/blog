# personal website

This builds my personal website https://andimiller.net/ using hakyll and a load of stuff

It is currently built:

1. using `nix` for package management
2. using `mdoc` to run scala in markdown
3. using `pandoc` standalone to render my CV
4. using `hakyll` to generate my blog

If you want to copy how I'm doing things, feel free, this is all effectively under the MIT license unless I've borrowed stuff from elsewhere in which case I'll usually have a header.
