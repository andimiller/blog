Since I got beta access to [Google Bard](https://bard.google.com/) I figured I'd try something out; I've heard they can help people code and will take my job away so let's try and do some coding with it.

Wait, hold up, is it just going to paste me a class from [Algebird](https://github.com/twitter/algebird/)? I guess that's fine, but does it know the ramifications of this?

That looks correct, but let me check...

Oh.
